    I wouldn't do that. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    The joyful mysteries &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Ever the Dull Alchemist [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Alright, who did it? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    I wouldn't worry about it. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    And, don't ever forget it. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    ] I have before me all the necessary ingredients [ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Relax, :^) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    All in. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Forgive me, I am sleepwalking &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Hold up a minute. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Don't touch that. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    ] It is their combination which eludes me &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    If I were you... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Me and You? You and I? I can't recall &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    A possession for all time &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Always remember, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Telling myself the story of my life &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    You don't have the wingspan for that. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Do I have the choice? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Step 1: Wake up at 3pm. Step 2: Get onto the computer.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    At first I didn't notice you &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Readiness to laugh. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Business or pleasure? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Step 1: Wake up at 3pm. Step 2: Get onto the computer.  </marquee>
